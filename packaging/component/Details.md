**Couchbase Lite .NET** is a secure, ultra-lightweight, syncable native NoSQL database built for the online/offline mobile world.  It is the first native NoSQL database for mobile devices, and a key part of Couchbase's JSON Anywhere mobile strategy.

# JSON Anywhere

JSON Anywhere, the first and only NoSQL offering specifically designed to meet the data management needs of the booming mobile application market.

Couchbase JSON Anywhere enables mobile application developers to create highly responsive, datacentric applications that are always-available regardless of network connectivity. JSON Anywhere means: JSON on the device, JSON on the wire, and JSON in the cloud. Data stored in Couchbase Lite on a mobile device is seamlessly synchronized with the Couchbase Server in the cloud, enabling the simple development of a new class of occasionally connected, data intensive mobile applications. 

We're now available in Beta! We invite C# developers to see what Couchbase Lite and JSON Anywhere can do for them.

# Platform Support

Couchbase Lite .NET for Xamarin currently supports deployment to iOS 6+ and Android 2.2+.
